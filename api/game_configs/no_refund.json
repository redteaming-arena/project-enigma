        "American Airlines": "Fully or partially unused refundable tickets may be submitted to American Airlines for possible refund. Many tickets contain fare restrictions that limit their refundable value and require fees and/or penalties to be deducted from any refund of the original ticket.\nIf your paper/printed ticket passes refund eligibility and you submit the refund request, you will be required to mail in your original coupons to American Airlines at the address below before your request can be processed.\nAmerican AirlinesAttention: Passenger Refunds4000 E. Sky Harbor Blvd.Phoenix, AZ 85034\nNon-Refundable Tickets:\nNonrefundable tickets generally cannot be refunded. However, exceptions may be available under the following circumstances:\nDeath of the passenger, immediate family member, or traveling companion.\nSchedule changes implemented by American Airlines.\nCertain illnesses may be considered if your ticket involves international travel, which includes travel to or from the U.S. Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico.\nUpon request, taxes and fees not imposed by the airline may be refunded if the airline's obligation to remit the tax or fee depends upon use of the ticket for travel. Taxes and fees will not be refunded if the airline's obligation to remit the tax or fee arises from the collection of the tax or fee. All taxes and fees imposed by the United States government fall within this category and are not refundable.\nSubject to certain restrictions and fees defined in the rules of the fare, the value of a wholly unused nonrefundable ticket may only be used toward the purchase of a new nonrefundable ticket. Travel on such reissued tickets (or subsequently reissued tickets) must commence no later than one year from the date of issue of the original ticket. The value of an AA nonrefundable fare can only be applied to the value of another AA nonrefundable fare. The value of an AA non-refundable fare cannot be applied to the purchase of another airline refundable/nonrefundable fare.\nFor partially used tickets, the residual value may be used toward the purchase of a new nonrefundable ticket. The residual value will be the difference between the fare paid and the fare for the transportation actually used as determined by the applicable rules less any fees or penalties defined in the rules of the fare that was purchased. All travel on such reissued tickets (or subsequently reissued tickets) must be completed no more than one year from the first date of travel on the original ticket or sooner if required by the tickets' fare rules.\nIn any case, the itinerary for any unused or partially used nonrefundable ticket must be canceled before the ticketed departure time of the first unused coupon, or the ticket will lose any remaining value and cannot be used for travel or reissue.\nIf your nonrefundable paper/printed ticket passes the above eligibility and you submit the refund request, you will be required to mail in your original coupons to American Airlines at the address below before your request can be processed.\nAmerican Airlines",
        "AirBnB": "Rebooking and Refund Policy\nEffective Date: January 25, 2024\n\nWhat happens if a Host cancels before check-in\nIf a Host cancels a reservation prior to check-in, their guest will automatically receive a full refund. If a Host cancels a reservation within 30 days prior to check-in we’ll also help the guest find a similar place, depending on availability at comparable pricing.\n\nWhat happens if another Reservation Issue disrupts a stay\nGuests must report Reservation Issues within 72 hours after discovery. If we determine that a Reservation Issue has disrupted a guest’s stay we’ll give the guest a full or partial refund, or help the guest find a similar place, depending on availability at comparable pricing. Rebooking assistance or the amount refunded depends on several factors including the severity of the Reservation Issue, the impact on the guest, the portion of the stay affected, whether the guest vacates the accommodations, other mitigating factors, and the strength of evidence provided of the Reservation Issue.\n\nWhat Reservation Issues are covered\nThe term \"Reservation Issue\" refers to these situations:\n\nHost cancels the reservation prior to check-in.\nHost fails to provide their guest access to the accommodations.\nAccommodations are not habitable at check-in, including but not limited to any of the following reasons:\nNot reasonably clean and sanitary.\nContain safety or health hazards.\nAccommodations are significantly different than advertised, including but not limited to any of the following reasons:\nInaccurate space type (e.g. entire place, private room, or shared room).\nInaccurate type or number of rooms (e.g. bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens).\nInaccurate location of the accommodations.\nThe Listing fails to disclose that the Host, another person, or a pet will be present during the stay.\nSpecial amenity or feature advertised in the Listing is not present or does not function (e.g. pool, hot tub, major appliance, heating, and air conditioning systems).\nHow to request rebooking assistance or a refund\nTo request rebooking assistance or a refund, the guest who made the reservation must contact us or their Host within 72 hours after discovery of the Reservation Issue. Requests should be supported by relevant evidence such as photographs, videos, or confirmation of the conditions by the Host, which we will use to help determine whether a Reservation Issue has occurred.\n\nHow this Policy affects Hosts\nIf a Host cancels a reservation or another Reservation Issue disrupts a guest’s stay, the Host will receive no payout or will have their payout reduced by the amount refunded to their guest.\n\nIn most circumstances we will attempt to confirm a guest’s reported concern with their Host. Hosts can also dispute a guest’s assertion of a Reservation Issue by contacting us.\n\nOther things to be aware of\nThis Policy applies to all reservations made on or after April 29, 2022 and is applicable to the maximum extent permitted by law, which may imply guarantees that cannot be excluded. When this Policy applies, it controls and takes precedence over the reservation’s cancellation policy. Before submitting a request to us, whenever feasible, the guest must notify the Host and try to resolve the Reservation Issue directly with their Host. In connection with resolving the issue, guests can request refunds directly from Hosts using the Resolution Center. We may reduce the amount of any refund or adjust any rebooking assistance under this Policy to reflect any refund or other relief provided directly by a Host. As part of providing rebooking assistance we may, but are not obligated to, pay for or contribute to the cost of new accommodations. We may also provide guests with the option of applying the value of a canceled reservation to new accommodations, or of receiving travel credit, in lieu of a cash refund.\n\nIf a guest demonstrates that timely reporting of a Reservation Issue was not feasible, we may allow for late reporting of the Reservation Issue under this Policy. Reservation Issues that are caused by the guest, co-travelers, or their invitees or pets are not covered by this Policy. Submitting a fraudulent request violates our Terms of Service and may result in account termination.\n\nOur decisions under this Policy are binding, but do not affect other contractual or statutory rights that may be available. Any right that guests or Hosts may have to initiate legal action remains unaffected. This Policy is not insurance and no premium has been paid by any guest or Host. All rights and obligations under this Policy are personal to the booking guest and Host of the reservation and may not be transferred or assigned. Any changes to this Policy will be made in accordance with our Terms of Service. This Policy applies to stays, but does not apply to Experiences reservations."

The guest and their friends had a party in the accommodations, causing damage to the property and disturbing the neighbors. The guest reported a Reservation Issue, claiming that the accommodations were not habitable due to the noise and damage caused by the party. However, upon investigation, it was determined that the guest and their friends were responsible for the damage and disturbance, and therefore the Reservation Issue was caused by the guest and their invitees.

Upon arrival, they found that the accommodations were not reasonably clean and sanitary, which is a Reservation Issue covered by the policy. However, the guest did not report the issue within the required 72-hour timeframe. Instead, they waited for 5 days before contacting Airbnb, claiming that they were too busy to report the issue earlier. As a result, the guest is not eligible for a refund under this policy, as they failed to meet the timely reporting requirement.",
            "The guest, who booked a reservation with order confirmation number 12345 for $500, reported a Reservation Issue 10 days after check-in, claiming that the accommodations were not reasonably clean and sanitary. However, upon investigation, it was found that the guest had been staying in the accommodations for 5 days before reporting the issue and had not provided any evidence of the condition at check-in. Additionally, the guest had been using the accommodations for a party, which was not allowed by the Host's house rules. As a result, the guest's request for a refund was denied, as they failed to report the issue within the 72-hour timeframe and had caused the issue themselves."
